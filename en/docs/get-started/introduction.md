The WSO2 Healthcare Solution is a solution built on top of the best in its industry, that been an open-source integration platform. The platform allows you to connect to disparate source systems (e.g., EHRs/EMRs, Claim Management Systems, Databases etc.), quickly transforming your data to/from healthcare message formats (e.g., FHIR, HL7, X12, CCDA etc.) and expose them through secure APIs.<br> Our main intent is to accelerate the development process of healthcare IT through auto generative, easily extensible and well supported set of healthcare accelerators.

Key offerings provided through the WSO2 Healthcare Solution are:

- **Structures and Standardizes Data for Better Interoperability** - Expose healthcare records over FHIR® APIs and build a FHIR® R4 server on top of the #1 open source hybrid API management platform. Supports future FHIR versions easily through a well-designed architecture of the solution.
- **Privacy and Security** - OpenID connect and end user claim based privacy controls are utilized on health data. SMART-on-FHIR specification is supported and enriched with latest advancements in the security domain such as multifactor authentication, adaptive authentication (i.e. authentication flows can be changed based on the attributes of the users).
- **Third Party Access Management** - Application developers can self register, and gain access to FHIR® APIs over OAuth 2.0. This enables them to search and discover all available APIs, read documentation, try them out—all through one portal. approve workflows. Further, consent management features are also supported to onboard third parties securely.
- **Enabling Patient Friendly Consent Requests and Managed Third Party Access to Secured Patient Health Information** - Customizable, robust out-of-the-box consent management functionality that enables simple deployment of patient friendly consent requests that meet mandated FHIR compliance requirements, provides secure third party access, future proofs your interoperability strategy, and more.
- **Integration and Data Transformation** - Easily integrate wearable devices (through standard protocols such as Websockets), EMR/EHR systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner, Athena Health and any system that exposes a REST API or a FHIR API), HTTP/ Websockets/ GraphQL services, databases, and many more. It also transforms data to FHIR® using prebuilt FHIR® accelerators. The platform's comprehensive tooling supports building, debugging, testing, and packaging your integrations.
- **Real-time Insights** - Generates rapid, insightful data-driven decisions by analyzing the traffic through the platform in near real-time.
- **API Marketplace** - Establish a transparent healthcare exchange to bring people, processes, and technology together. Expand your API visibility and increase your interoperability score.
